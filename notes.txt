Well, hello there.  This is a notepad for today.

1:24pm: I'm still sitting at this chair.  I'm adding a modification that I will then stage and commit into GIT.  Notice that there is no line return and this can go on forever and ever and ever and ever..........

8/15: 1:18pm: In a shockingly similar amount of time, it turns out that I'm once again editing notes.txt.  This time, we'll be pushing it to github!
